Follow these instructions to test the library as an npm dependency before publishing to npm registry. `Node` has to installed globally to run these instructions. Checkout to the required branches in both websdk and jssip-2 repositories before starting.

#### Step 1

In the `jssip-2` repo, from the root directory, run this command to add the repo to the global node_modules in the machine. If any error around access, try the same command with `sudo`

```
npm link

```
npm link plivo-jssip
```
